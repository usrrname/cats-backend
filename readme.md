## About

This project contains an Express server that offers 2 endpoints to send JSON data from a Google sheet that was exported from JotForm. Jotforms was used to collect survey results on a UX-for-cats project.
The front end is [here](https://github.com/usrrname/cats)
Actual site is deployed on NearlyFreeSpeech I blogged about it [here](https://dev.to/jenninat0r/hastily-deploying-a-node-app-on-nearlyfreespeechnet-mac-os-42l7)
